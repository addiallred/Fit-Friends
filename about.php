Although gym buddies are great, as they hold us accountable to going to the gym and help motivate us while working out, scheduling a time for you and a friend to go to the gym can be extremly difficult, until now. Fit Friends allows you to follow all of your friends, view their workout schedule, and add one of their workouts to your schedule so you can go to the gym with them. You can also see if anyone is holding a fitness class or personal time that you can attend. Fit friends allows you to get your gym buddy back and get back into the gym with ease!</p>

		    	<p id="about-who">Who are we? Founded by Addison Allred, a CS student at USC, we are a team of developers who are passionate about developing software that will impact individual lives. Addison always found it rather difficult to find time to go to the gym, and be held accountable for attending the gym. By creating Fit Friends, Addison was able to successfully achieve her fitness goals by posting her schedule, and having her friends workout with her. We hope that by using Fit Friends, you will be able to create a healthy relationship with working out and be able to do it along side your friends.
